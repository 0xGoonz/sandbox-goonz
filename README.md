# Sandbox Goonz

This is a personal test repository for experimenting with basic GitHub features, commit flow, and development workflow setup.

## What I'm doing here
- Practicing commits and file creation
- Testing README updates
- Preparing for future backend development (e.g., Firebase & Web3 stuff)

## Day Logs
- Day 2: Initial setup and README update
